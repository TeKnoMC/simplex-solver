# Linear Programming Solver - Simplex Algorithm
This react app implements the Simplex algorithm, which is used to solve maximisation linear programming (LP) problems.

## Example problem
An example LP problem is as follows:

Maximise P = 4x + 3y
Subject to:
    4x + 5y <= 40
    6x + 7y <= 42
    x, y >= 0
